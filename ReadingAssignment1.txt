I think this article was interesting because it showcased both the pros and cons of microservices and microservice architecture. Through the first two lectures it seemed more and more apparent that microservices should always win out over a monolithic model for a business software solution, this goes more into details on parts we haven’t covered yet. This includes the complexity of microservice architecture, and the higher-level operational costs when it comes to team and code management. 

To recap the article, it goes in depth explaining the concepts of microserves, which are independently deployable and scalable code components which handle singular pieces of business logic. The goal, according to the article, is not necessarily to make the microservices as small as possible, but rather to make them as agile as possible which contributes to the project’s ability to achieve continuous delivery.
